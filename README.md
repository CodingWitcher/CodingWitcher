# About Me : 

In a nutshell, I am an undergraduate passionate about **Artificial General Intelligence(in this Big Data era)** and how modern day machines leverage these tools in order to accomplish gruesome tasks such as Vision and decoding patterns.

For the past year and a half, I have been deeply involved in the projects revolving around data science and Machine Learning. Working at the intersection of these fields in domains such as **Analytics** and **Computer Vision** is my primary area of interest around which I aim to weave my professional career. 

Apart from the professional sphere, I cherish traveling, playing lawn tennis, star-gazing, reading novels, PC gaming and orating.
